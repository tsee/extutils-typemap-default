=head1 NAME

ExtUtils::Typemap::Basic - A set of typemaps for simple types

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use ExtUtils::Typemap::Basic;
  # First, read my own type maps:
  my $private_map = ExtUtils::Typemap->new(file => 'my.map');
  
  # Then, get additional typemaps and merge them into mine
  $private_map->merge(typemap => ExtUtils::Typemap::Basic->new);
  
  # Now, write the combined map to an output file
  $private_map->write(file => 'typemap');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<ExtUtils::Typemap::Basic> is an C<ExtUtils::Typemap>
subclass that provides a set of mappings for some basic
integer, unsigned, and floating point types that aren't
in perl's builtin typemap.

=head1 METHODS

These are the overridden methods:

=head2 new

Creates a new C<ExtUtils::Typemap::Basic> object.
It acts as any other C<ExtUtils::Typemap> object, except that
it has the object maps initialized.

  @iv_types = map {($_, "signed $_")} @iv_types;
